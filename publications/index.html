In both communication treatments, participants start out proposing and voting for prosocial allocations and increase their support for majority tyranny allocations as the experiment progresses. Private communication therefore increases the prevalence of majority tyranny (but is not strictly necessary for it). The results demonstrate that the effects of private communication in multilateral bargaining extend to public goods settings, despite the contrasting finding in the latter that democratic institutions enhance prosocial outcomes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">R&amp;P</abbr></div> <div id="MinozziWoon:2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Electability salience can bias voting decisions</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://minozzi.github.io/aboutme/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Minozzi</a>, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Research &amp; Politics</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680231159074" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> “Electability” received considerable attention during the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, with some critics claiming that the term was code for sexism. From a rational choice perspective, “electability” could affect voting in multiple ways, including via expected utility; previous scholarship suggests that many voters consider it as such. Yet this scholarship ignores the role that salience plays in decision making, and is silent on which sorts of candidate might benefit from the effects of priming electability. To address these issues, we conducted a survey experiment during the 2020 primary season, measuring Democratic primary voters’ preferences for candidates, electability estimates, and candidate rankings. Our experiment manipulated salience by randomizing the order in which preferences and electability were elicited. We show that electability salience caused a substantial increase in the probability that a respondent made decisions based only on electability. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JEcPsy</abbr></div> <div id="BurdeaWoon:2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Online belief elicitation methods</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://valeriaburdea.weebly.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Valeria Burdea</a>, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Economic Psychology</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487022000149" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>How well do incentivized belief elicitation procedures work in online settings? We evaluate the quality of beliefs elicited from online respondents, comparing several characteristics of two widely used complex elicitation mechanisms (the Binarized Scoring Rule – BSR – and a stochastic variation of the Becker–deGroot–Marschak mechanism—BDM) against a flat fee baseline for a variety of beliefs (induced probabilities, first-order factual knowledge, second-order knowledge of others). We find that the flat-fee method requires the least amount of time, the BDM is the most difficult to understand, and that there are no differences in the average accuracy of induced beliefs across conditions. However, the methods are significantly different in terms of the frequency of first-order and second-order beliefs reported at exactly 50%: the flat-fee method leads to the most mass on this belief, followed by BDM and BSR. Regarding induced beliefs, we also find that less-educated participants’ accuracy is higher in the complex incentives treatments, and that attention, numeracy, and education are positively associated with the quality of these beliefs across methods. Our results suggest that the quality of beliefs elicited in online environments may depend less on the formal incentive compatibility properties of the elicitation procedure (whether the procedure prevents “dishonest” reporting) than on the difficulty of comprehending the task and how well incentives induce cognitive effort (thereby inducing subjects to quantify or construct their beliefs).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PS</abbr></div> <div id="Woon_etal:2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Trump Is Not a (Condorcet) Loser!

This claim rests on the implicit assumption that Trump would have been defeated in a head-to-head contest against another candidate—that he was a Condorcet loser. Conventional pre-election polls, however, do not provide enough information about voters’ preferences to assess the plausibility of this claim. Relying on novel data to construct individuals’ complete preferences over the set of leading Republican candidates, we find that no other candidate strictly defeats Trump in pairwise majority-rule comparisons and—far from being a Condorcet loser—that Trump is a member of the majority-rule core. Our results question the plausibility of the coordination narrative because Trump’s support was wider than political observers believed: it came from a broad base of the Republican primary electorate rather than a small but intense minority.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JEBO</abbr></div> <div id="CookWoon:2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Time and punishment: Blame and concession in political standoffs</div> <div class="author"> Ian Palmer Cook, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117300033" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Political negotiation frequently looks like two sides staring each other down, waiting for the other to blink. In these showdowns, neither side wishes to concede, claiming that doing so would incur the wrath of voters. Whether this consideration of potential punishment influences behavior during stalemates is not well understood, and little theory or evidence exists to explain how voters allocate blame for different outcomes. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate two interrelated questions: how does anticipation of blame drive behavior, and how do observers with a stake in the outcome allocate blame? In our experiment, we adopt a dynamic war of attrition to model a negotiating situation in which concession time is the key choice variable, and our design compares versions of the game with and without an observer (whose payoffs depend on the outcome and who can punish the players). We find that the presence of the observer shortens the duration of standoffs and leads to outcomes that favor the observer. We also find that observers tend to punish the winning player and that the level of punishment depends on the alignment between the observer and players. The experimental data are qualitatively consistent with instrumental punishment, but the magnitude tends to be less than optimal, possibly reflecting subjects’ behavioral or emotional responses.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JBEE</abbr></div> <div id="MinozziWoon:2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Direct response and the strategy method in an experimental cheap talk game</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://minozzi.github.io/aboutme/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Minozzi</a>, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804319300230" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In cheap talk games, equilibrium analysis predicts extreme limits on the information that can be transmitted when senders and receivers have different goals. Yet experimental evidence suggests that senders overcommunicate relative to this baseline, revealing more information than predicted in equilibrium. We propose that overcommunication may be due in part to limited cognitive engagement by subjects, captured by level-k thinking. To test this conjecture, we compare two elicitation methods, direct response and the strategy method, holding other elements of the game fixed. Existing experimental studies of cheap talk games use the standard direct response method, while the strategy method—in which subjects make selections for all contingent choices—is believed to encourage more thoughtful decisionmaking. We therefore expect senders to transmit less information with the strategy method than with direct response. In contrast, we find the reverse: the strategy method increased overcommunication. Further examination suggests that this occurred because senders played more naïvely with the strategy method than with direct response. Our findings suggest that the strategy method and direct response do not elicit the same choices in cheap talk games.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">GEB</abbr></div> <div id="MinozziWoon:2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The limited value of a second opinion: Competition and exaggeration in experimental cheap talk games</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://minozzi.github.io/aboutme/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Minozzi</a>, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Games and Economic Behavior</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825619300740" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We experimentally investigate the effect of a second opinion on information transmission.

We find that strong office motives clearly induce exaggeration and, surprisingly, that only about half of laboratory candidates tell the truth even when incentives are completely aligned. We show that the prevalence of lying in elections results not from impure (e.g., Machiavellian) motives, but rather as a rational response to the expectation that other candidates will lie.

In a controlled incentivized experiment, I find that candidates diverge substantially and that primaries have little effect on average positions.

Most subjects respond to changes in their own values, but few subjects conditionally respond to cross-player changes. We also administer two information-based treatments—feedback and a calculator—finding that feedback on past play has a stronger effect on decreasing socially wasteful effort than a payoff calculator.

Instead, behavior is consistent with a naive form of exaggeration in which senders know they must exaggerate, but they do so in an understated way that is less responsive to their private information or to opponents’ past behavior than would be fully optimal.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PA</abbr></div> <div id="WoonCook:2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Competing Gridlock Models and Status Quo Policies</div> <div class="author"> <em>Jonathan Woon</em>, and Ian Palmer Cook</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Political Analysis</em>, 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpv004" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Spatial theories of lawmaking predict that legislative productivity is increasing in the number of status quo policies that lie outside the gridlock interval, but because locations of status quo policies are difficult to measure, previous empirical tests of gridlock theories rely on an auxiliary assumption that the distribution of status quo points is fixed and uniform. This assumption is at odds with the theories being tested, as it ignores the history dependence of lawmaking. We provide an alternative method for testing competing theories by estimating structural models that explicitly account for temporal dependence in a theoretically consistent way. Our analysis suggests that legislative productivity depends both on parties and supermajority pivots, and we find patterns of productivity consistent with a weaker, contingent form of party influence than found in previous work. Parties appear to exert agenda power only on highly salient legislation rather than strongly influencing outcomes through voting pressure and party unity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">AJPS</abbr></div> <div id="KW:2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Women Don’t Run?

This difference does not arise from disparities in abilities, risk aversion, or beliefs, but rather from the specific competitive and strategic context of campaigns and elections.

The data suggest that subjects playing the role of politicians fail to take advantage of voters even though voters indeed create the predicted electoral incentives, albeit in a weaker form than predicted by the theory.

Although members of Congress and the president often decry lengthy delays in the passage of appropriations bills, we investigate whether such delays might confer strategic advantages, and if so, to whom. We draw from bargaining theory to understand how the relationship between the duration of negotiations and outcomes depends on the underlying distribution of bargaining power and the nature of the bargaining process. In our empirical analysis, we find that delay is associated with greater concessions to the president, but not with more extreme outcomes. We also find that the House and Senate concede more to presidents who prefer less spending, while the Senate is more responsive to presidential needs during presidential election years. These results suggest that the president’s power comes from the asymmetry of veto and proposal rights, rather than from symmetric bargaining with proposals and counterproposals or a “war of nerves.” </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JTP</abbr></div> <div id="MinozziWoon:2013" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lying aversion, lobbying, and context in a strategic communication experiment</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://minozzi.github.io/aboutme/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Minozzi</a>, and <em>Jonathan Woon</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Theoretical Politics</em>, 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0951629813477276" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Almost all institutions within modern democracies depend on a mix of communication and competition. However, most formal theory and experimental evidence ignores one of these two features. We present a formal theory of communicative competition in which senders vary in their aversion to lying, and test hypotheses from this theory using a strategic communication experiment. To influence lying aversion, we compare a Context Condition, in which pre-play instructions are cast in political language, with a Baseline Condition, in which all language is abstract. We find that in early rounds of play, subjects in the Context Condition exaggerated more as a function of their biases than those in the Baseline Condition when we control for the past history of play. However, by the last round of play, subjects in both conditions converged on persistent exaggeration.

If voters are forward-looking but uncertain about politicians’ unobservable characteristics, then it is rational to focus on selection. But doing so undermines democratic accountability because selection renders sanctioning an empty threat. In contrast to rational choice predictions, the experimental results indicate a strong behavioral tendency to use a retrospective voting rule. Additional experiments support the interpretation that retrospective voting is a simple heuristic that voters use to cope with a cognitively difficult inference and decision problem and, in addition, suggest that voters have a preference for accountability. The results pose a challenge for theories of electoral selection and voter learning and suggest new interpretations of empirical studies of economic and retrospective voting.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2011</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">AJPS</abbr></div> <div id="HWW:2011" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An Experimental Investigation of Electoral Delegation and the Provision of Public Goods</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://myweb.fsu.edu/jhamman/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">John R.

However, we also observe outcomes in which a minimum winning coalition exploits the contributions of the remaining players. A second experiment demonstrates that when electoral delegation must be endogenously implemented, individuals voluntarily cede authority to an elected agent only when preplay communication is permitted.

If they do, when the median is pivotal and legislators’ goals reflect both position taking and policy seeking, greater influence over the agenda leads legislators to moderate their bills relative to legislators with lower agenda priority. Analysis of a formal game theoretic model provides rigorous justification for the proposition, and empirical analysis of House and Senate bills from the 101st to 108th Congresses using cosponsorship data to measure the ideological locations of bills largely supports it. Committee leadership and majority party status have moderating effects while the effect of committee membership is slight. The analysis also tentatively supports the pivotalness of the median over other alternatives. Contrary to the view that bill sponsorship is mere position taking, legislative organization significantly shapes early-stage legislative behavior.

Voters in several states selected the base of their state legislative apportionment through the initiative process prior to the reapportionment revolution of the 1960s, which provides a unique opportunity to answer this question. This study examines 13 such initiatives in four states between 1924 and 1962. Four factors are hypothesized to influence vote choice on these initiatives: urban-rural confict, partisanship, race, and economic self-interest. Through regression analysis of the county-level vote in these elections I find that economic self-interest consistently influences voter support for apportionment initiatives while these other factors influence it only occasionally. This finding suggests that distributive politics drive voters’ evaluation of representative institutions and that the influence of other political factors depends on the historical and local context of an initiative. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Jonathan Woon.
